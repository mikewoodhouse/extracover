## Purpose

(if anyone happens upon this...)

To investigate the evolution of cricket innings in (initially) T20 matches and to explore the extent to which predictions may be made by applying relevant factors as a series of "overlay" factors based on historic data before the start of the game abd whether in-game factors such as pitch conditions, weather etc can be derived and applied to increase accuracy as the innings develops.
