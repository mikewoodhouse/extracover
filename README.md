## Purpose

(if anyone happens upon this...)

To investigate the evolution of cricket innings in (initially) T20 matches and to explore the extent to which predictions may be made by applying relevant factors as a series of "overlay" factors based on historic data before the start of the game abd whether in-game factors such as pitch conditions, weather etc can be derived and applied to increase accuracy as the innings develops.

## Data TODOs

* Classify players:
  * bowl style
  * handedness
* Classify events
  * Domestic
  * International & "level"
* Rule variations
  * noballs - when is the deduction one and when two? Is it possible to identify as a match condition or do we need to look into competition? `info.match_type_number`, perhaps? When there are batter runs then the size of the penalty is obvious, it's otherwise that might be a problem...
